Provides support for DB2 for iSeries for remote python clients using IBM i Access Client Solutions ODBC driver


Other work in this area includes the ibm_db_ and ibm_db_sa_ projects, which also provide access to DB2 and support SQLAlchemy. Those two packages rely on and automatically install a binary driver for DB2, while this package relies on you already having install the `i Access Client Solutions ODBC`_ driver available on IBM's support/download site.
